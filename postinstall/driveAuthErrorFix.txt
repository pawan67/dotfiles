If the /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-default.rules file is blank or does not exist, that could potentially be the cause of your PolicyKit authentication issue. This file typically contains the default rules for PolicyKit on your system. Since it's empty, it may not be properly configured.

To resolve this issue, you can create a new 50-default.rules file with the appropriate default rules. Here's how you can do it:

Open a terminal.

Use a text editor, such as nano or vim, to create and edit the 50-default.rules file:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-default.rules
Add the following default PolicyKit rules to the file:

javascript
Copy code
/* Allow members of the wheel group to execute any actions
   without authentication */
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
    if (subject.isInGroup("wheel")) {
        return polkit.Result.YES;
    }
});
Save the file and exit the text editor.

Restart the polkit service to apply the changes:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart polkit
Test whether the issue is resolved by attempting the action that previously triggered the PolicyKit authentication error.

These default rules are permissive and should allow members of the "wheel" group to execute actions without authentication. If you need more specific rules or have more complex policy requirements, you may need to create additional rules in this file. However, the above rules should help resolve the immediate issue of PolicyKit authentication errors.

After creating and configuring the 50-default.rules file, you should be able to perform system actions that require authentication without encountering the "Not authorized to perform operation" error.
